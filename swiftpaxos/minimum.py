    Ruijie: I think to prioritize nodes, you should start replicas in order of priority and ensure that the order is not messed up.

    Finds the optimal priority assignment for a set of nodes to minimize a calculated average value.

    Problem Description:
    Given a square n*n matrix representing the distances between n nodes, the goal is to find an optimal
    assignment of unique priorities to each node. The optimality is defined by minimizing the average
    of a specific value calculated for each node. The process involves iterating through every possible
    priority permutation.

    For each node (let's call it the 'current_node'), a value is calculated based on its distances to
    other nodes, conditioned by their relative priorities. The calculation rule is as follows:

    1.  Partition all other nodes into two groups: those with a higher priority and those with a
        lower priority than the 'current_node'.

    2.  A threshold `k` is defined as half the total number of nodes (n // 2). The set of nodes used for
        the final calculation must contain `k` nodes.

    3.  First, consider all nodes with a higher priority.
        - If the number of these higher-priority nodes is less than `k`, we must select additional nodes
          from the lower-priority group to meet the count of `k`. These supplemental nodes are chosen
          sequentially, starting with the one closest to the 'current_node', until the total count of
          selected nodes reaches `k`.
        - If the number of higher-priority nodes is already `k` or more, we use only this set of
          higher-priority nodes for the calculation.

    4.  The value for the 'current_node' is the maximum distance from it to any of the nodes in the
        set determined in the previous step. If the set is empty (which can happen for the highest
        priority node when k=0), its value is 0.

    5.  After calculating this value for every node under a specific priority assignment, the average
        of these values is computed.

    6.  The function iterates through all n! possible priority assignments and returns the assignment
        that results in the minimum possible average value.
